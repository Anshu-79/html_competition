		<h3>Dear parents,</h3>
		<p>We are living in the age where the world is shrinking and the scope of knowledge<br>is enlarging and we have to learn fast to keep abreast with the latest inventions<br>and advancements taking place all around us. Time and space are being<br>conquered. Life is a process of constant learning. A bend in road does not mean<br>the end of the road. The aim of education is also to make one mentally tough as<br>well as to chisel the students into good and responsible citizens. Schools are<br>temples of learning where raw seedlings come, we nurture, bloom them into<br>flowers which spread their fragrance of knowledge all around. Our endeavour is<br>to make them the Brand Ambassadors of our school. If you have knowledge, let<br>others light their candles with it. In the end it is not the years in your life that<br>counts, it's the life in your years. Remember that when the going gets tough, the<br>tough gets going.<br><br>So let us step into a new era with the hope and aspiration of optimism and open mind.<br><br>Warm regards,<br><br><i>Dr. Sanjeev Jain</i>
